# OverView
The purpose of this project is to show my skills in data cleaning in SQL. For example null values are populated as property address and update the table.
I am not trying to find any objective in this project, but showing my data cleaning skills. There can be mroe porcessing, but it depends on the objective of this project.
Therefore, I did not go overboard and kept it as simple as I could.
